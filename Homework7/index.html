        <div class = "text3">Women at all times are concerned about the same question: “How to become the most beautiful?” To achieve
            the goal, they do not spare either time, or money, or energy. True, the very concept of beauty has changed greatly in different
            eras. The standard of feminine beauty changed constantly, depending on the historical period. In the Middle Ages, fashion was
            fragility, which was sometimes achieved with a banal hunger strike. Pale skin was a success, for this woman used lead white.
            The presence of a high forehead was considered beautiful, for this medieval ladies shaved their hair over their foreheads,
            visually increasing it. Later (in the 18th and 19th centuries) they were admired by already magnificent beauties. 
            The honor was the presence of fat folds, sloping shoulders, lush bust. <br>The 20th century was marked by the popularity
            of such people as Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor and other Hollywood divas. Slender, but at the same time feminine
            and sexy women came into fashion. At the end of the 20th century, incredible thinness became fashionable, everyone
            wanted to be like “hangers” from the catwalk. In pursuit of beauty, the girls again starved themselves, earning
            health problems, both physical and psychological.<br> Of course, there is no limit to perfection. Previously,
            the main purpose of life was to get married successfully, the girls had to go to great lengths to charm a man.
            But even now, when the situation has changed, we continue to torment ourselves with questions: “How do you like
            a man?” And for some reason no one is interested in the opinions of the male representatives. And it would
            be worth it.<br> You would expect a lot of amazing discoveries. After all, many men on the contrary laugh
            at girls with duck lips, eyebrows “like Brezhnev’s”, too thin or dressed in something incredible and uncomfortable.
            Most men like well-groomed girls with beautiful hair, not catchy make-up, neat nails of not bright tones. 
            Attractive for them may be girls in a simple skirt and a white blouse. <br>Classic is always in fashion!
            So do not rush to carry out experiments on yourself, but first put your thoughts in order. And remember
            that appearances are not everything.</div>
